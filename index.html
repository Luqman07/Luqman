            <p>This report is from one of guy. He narrated an event that occurred at his PPA (Place of Primary Assignment) which goes as thus,
            <p>Before I proceed let me give you guys small backstory. My guy is also a Corp member like me who was posted to a secondary school at Ido LGA in Oyo State. He teaches Agricultural Science to the JSS 2 and SSS 2 pupils.</p> 
            <p>It was about time for the school to appoint new prefects so the teachers chose 60 pupils 45 girls 15 boys. The pupils were summoned to the staff room for a screening exercise. So, my guy was unaware of this which prompted him to enquire from the teachers what was going on (if they wanted to scold them), the teachers then informed him that they wanted to appoint new prefects for the school and they wanted the Corp members to be part of the screening exercise. The teachers asked the Corp members for suggestions regarding the screening exercise and my guy gave a spelling exercise suggestion (these students are in the Senior Secondary level specifically SS 2) and the teachers agreed.</p>
            <p>The screening exercise began, my guy was appointed the coordinator. He ordered them to spell these 5 words which are Catarrh, Pneumonia, Rhythm, Staff (he couldn’t recollect the 5th word, this all happened few weeks before the lockdown), about 50% got the 0 mark and the highest was 3. The students with the 0 mark were automatically screened out leaving about 30 of which they needed only 20 students so they had to conduct another screening exercise, the teachers then instructed my guy to ease up on the words (meaning the previous set of were difficult for a senior secondary school student to spell). Now the new words were Trouser, Partner, Bicycle, Exercise. Although, this time majority scored 5 some still didn’t do well. Then they moved on to the next stage which was supposed to designate the posts to the students, I’d call this stage The Manifesto Stage.</p>
            <p>The Manifesto Stage began, they asked the girls to step forward if any of them was interested in the Senior girl post (Head girl) and 4 of them did, I’ll be referring to the girls as Student A, B, C and D. According to the narration, the questions for the manifesto were Introductions, plans for the school and plans after school. Student A went first, she introduced herself and went on to say her best food was Rice and Beans and then the teachers asked her to explain how Rice and beans was prepared (like that was a criteria to becoming a good head girl, at this point I was blown away) only Student D was impressive, she spoke really well with very little or no grammatical errors, her plan is to be a Chartered Accountant and surprisingly she knew she had to do an ICAN to become one and trust me with the calibre of students in that school you’ll be amazed she knew what an ICAN was. Student D was appointed the head girl. Now onto the boys' Manifesto. </p>
            <p>Five of them stepped out for the boys, I’ll be using Student V, W, X, Y, Z. Student U and V performed badly (according to my guy they were just saying kan tan kan tan). Student X came in and was doing really well until he said his best color was green and they told him to step aside and concluded he was going to be the Labour prefect because his best color was green. Although, they already had a potential head boy because he was appointed the time keeper when he was in ss1 and I know you understand that concept. He was student Y and he was also doing okay until they asked him what he would like to become and he said he wanted to become an Alfa and then they turned to my guy(being the only Muslim Corp member in the school) and said Omo yin fe dabi yin( your student wants to be like you) which made my guy furious and pointed out to the student and teacher that Being an Alfa is not an occupation. This declaration discouraged them from appointing him the head boy. Student Z did well and was appointed the head boy. </p>
                
            <p>In conclusion, the educational system in some part of the country is highly discouraging. At this point I am choosing to not blame the government cause if the teachers that are in place to shape these pupils have also lost faith and concluded that these students can not be better. Teachers in this country have lost the sight of what being a teacher entail. </p>
            <p>I had to trim this as much as I could so I could not showcase the wrongdoings of these teachers probably I would do that in my next release. </p>
